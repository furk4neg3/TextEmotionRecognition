# Text Emotion Recognition
In this project, I've created AI models to predict emotion based on texts. I've used RNN and transfer learning for that. Best model works with 96% accuracy. All data preparation and preprocessing is done by me. Dataset is from Kaggle, link can be found in the notebook.

IMPORTANT NOTE: In the last model, I was going to use TinyBERT model. I tried it and it was taking too long to train, so I switched to USE. But in the naming part, it's still Model 5 (TinyBERT). To fix this issue, I should run the notebook again only changing the name part on the last 2 or 3 cells, which is not worth the time (it's going to take ~3 hours). Please be aware of this naming issue.
